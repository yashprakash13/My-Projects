# Chest X-Ray Classification

This Project is about training a Convolutional Neural Network on a Dataset of Chest X Rays of 5 different diseases (Dataset is available in the link below, it is made by me. ); Then, to make it successfully predict the disease in a given new Chest X-Ray.

**I was able to achieve 96% accuracy using the model on Validation/Test dataset I had made. XRays.py is the model for this one.

The dataset is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/yashprakash13/chest-xrays-dataset

I am also working on a project to export and deploy this trained model into an Android application, so that a user could use his camera to take the picture of the X-Ray and hence use my app-model to predict the disease in it.

***XR.py is the second version of the same project, but with a different dataset and approach.

I trained a model on the NIH X-RAYS Dataset from Kaggle. On this one, I achieved an accuracy of 88% on the Test Set. The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/sample
